Remember:

on file create_user.sql, you have to set you own password..
if youre work is done, remove it. it's a security risc..

on the tables are one host used with name '%'
this is a dummy and stand for: all. it's a security risc..
better is to set for all hosts: the real name.. 
and not insert values that not is used..
